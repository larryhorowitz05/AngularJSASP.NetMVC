<div class="title"><span>E-SIGN CONSENT TO USE ELECTRONIC RECORDS AND SIGNATURES</span></div>
<br />
<p>
    We prefer to do business with you electronically. If you would prefer, we can still assist you with your home loan in person, through the mail, or over the phone. Before we continue with this transaction electronically, it is important to us that you understand your rights and responsibilities.
</p>
<p>
    Please read the following and, if you wish, affirm your consent to conduct business with us electronically. For purposes of this Disclosure, “you” and “your” mean the borrower(s) in this home loan transaction and “we”, “our” and “us” mean New Leaf Lending, a Division of Skyline Financial Corp, which provides the NewLeaf Lending web site as a service provider of Skyline.
</p>
<span class="heading">Scope of Communications to Be Provided in Electronic Form</span>
<br />
<br />
<p>
    We may provide you with many communications and disclosures about your home loan transaction (“Communications”) electronically, instead of in writing (i.e., rather than paper which we mail or give you face-to-face). Your consent to receive electronic Communications includes, but is not limited to:
</p>
<p class="indent">
    Your Uniform Residential Loan Application (Form 1003);
    <br /> All legal and regulatory disclosures, such as your Good Faith Estimate and Initial Truth in Lending Disclosure;
    <br /> Privacy policies and notices; and,
    <br /> Communications associated with your home loan transaction.
</p>
<p>
    Your consent will only apply to delivery of Communications during the processing of this home loan transaction. Your consent does not apply to monthly statements or other disclosures related to the servicing of your home after it closes. Your consent also does not apply to other home loans or financial services that you may obtain from us in the future.
</p>
<span class="heading">Methods of Electronic Delivery of Communications to You</span>
<br />
<br />
<p>
    We will deliver all Communications by e-mail, on this web site, on another web site that we designate after notifying you of the web site’s URL by e-mail, or by fax to a fax number that you designate.
</p>
<span class="heading">Hardware and Software Requirements</span>
<br />
<br />
<p>
    In order to access, view, and retain your Communications, you must have:
</p>
<p class="indent">
    An e-mail account with an Internet service provider capable of sending and receiving e-mail with hyperlinks to web sites;
    <br /> A personal computer (for PCs: Pentium 120 Hhz or higher; for Macintosh, Power Mac 9500, Power PC 604 processor 120-MHz Base or higher), operating system and telecommunications connections to the Internet capable of receiving, accessing, displaying, and either printing or storing Communications;
    <br /> Adobe Reader version 8.0 or higher; Windows 2000 or later version running either Internet Explorer version 6.0 or higher or Firefox version 3.0 or higher, or Macintosh OSX 10.2 or higher running Safari web browser; and,
    <br /> Sufficient electronic storage capacity on your computer’s hard drive or other data storage unit or a printer to print a copy of your disclosures.
</p>
<p>
    Documents may be provided in HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or Portable Document Format (PDF) or other compatible formats. If you do not have the ability to access and retain both PDF and HTML documents, do not consent to electronic delivery. By consenting, you confirm that your personal computer is equipped with the Adobe Acrobat Reader.
</p>
<p>
    If software or hardware requirements change and you are no longer able to access Communications electronically as a result, you must notify us. Once you do so, we will then send you paper copies of future Communications by mail. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you before such requirements change.
</p>
<span class="heading">Updating Us on Your Contact Information</span>
<br />
<br />
<p>
    You must promptly notify us if your email address or other contact information changes. We will not assume any liability for non-receipt of Communications resulting from you failing to notify us of such changes, providing us an invalid email address, failing to set your email or Internet service provider filters so that our emails are not treated as “spam” or “junk mail,” or malfunctioning of your computer, browser, Internet service and/or software, or other reasons beyond our control.
</p>
<span class="heading">Withdrawing Your Consent</span>
<br />
<br />
<p>
    We will continue to deliver Communications about your home loan transaction electronically unless and until you withdraw your consent as described below. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. If you decide to withdraw your consent, you can do so by clicking on “I Decline” on the “My Profile” page or by contacting us at (877) 222-4444. After you withdraw your consent in this manner, we will provide you all future Communications in writing (i.e., on paper which we mail or give you face-to-face). There is no cost for withdrawing your consent.
</p>
<span class="heading">Requesting Paper Copies</span>
<br />
<br />
<p>
    We will not send you a paper copy of any Communication unless you request it. You can get a paper copy of any electronic Communication by asking us to mail it to you. You must make such a request within a reasonable time after we first provide the electronic Communication to you. To request a paper copy, call us at (877) 222-4444 or write to us at:
